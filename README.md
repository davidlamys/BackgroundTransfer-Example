# BackgroundTransfer-Example
An example project looking at how to implement background transfers on iOS

In order to run this project, you will need to register with Imgur to get a client-id token to access Imgur's API (which the project uses to get its example content). Once you have your client-id, add it to the project as the value of the clientID property in the RequestConfig class and the project should now run. If you have any trouble getting the project to run, please create an issue or get in touch with me on Twitter at wibosco.
